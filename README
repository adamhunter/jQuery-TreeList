This is a super simple jQuery treelist.  It supports an infinite depth of nested lists.  
The first version currently only supports using <ul>, varying html support to be added in the future
*cough cough* feel free to fork it.

example html

<ul>
  <li>List Item 1</li>
  <li class="open"><!-- will stay open -->
    <span class="expander"></span>
    List Item 2
    <ul>
      <li>Sub List Item 1</li>
      <li><!-- will close if js is available -->
        <span class="expander"></span>
        Sub List Item 2
        <ul>
          <li>Deep List Item 1</li>
          <li>Deep List Item 2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sub List Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>List Item 3</li>
</ul>


The span.expander can be any element with any class.  It does however need to be inside the <li> that contains the nested <ul>

To kick off the treelist, just use $('#nav').treelist() with the selector being the outermost <ul> element. To change the "expander" class, just use $('#nav').treelist({expander : '.some-other-class'}); (notice it's a full selector, including the .)

The list will also hide any sub menu that doesn't belong to an li with the class of open.  This is done via javascript so that it degrades nicely.  

Example:
$('#nav').treelist()
